I am a Machine Learning Engineer at Apple working on world and spatiotemporal modeling, with a research focus on enabling machines to represent, understand, and predict real-world physical environments. My work centers on learning-based models that capture geometric structure, temporal dynamics, and physical consistency from visual data.

Across academia and industry, my research spans 3D reconstruction, active perception, and generative world models, with applications in autonomous systems, robotics, and spatial computing. I have contributed original research published in leading computer vision and robotics venues, and actively serve as a peer reviewer for top-tier AI and robotics conferences and journals.
