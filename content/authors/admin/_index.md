I am a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at [Matterport](https://matterport.com), focusing on 3D Computer Vision.

During my Ph.D. study at Clemson University, I was focused on geometric learning in 3D Computer Vision, specifically Depth Estimation, 3D Reconstruction, and Neural Radiance Fields.

Prior to Matterport, I took a research internship at Google, worked with [Cl√©ment Godard](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/c.godard/) and Lynn Tsai on [Project Starline](https://blog.google/technology/research/project-starline/).
