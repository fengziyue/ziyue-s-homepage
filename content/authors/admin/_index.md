Ziyue Feng is a Ph.D. student at Clemson University. His research interests include Computer vision, Machine Learning, and Autonomous Driving. He is now focused on Depth Estimation and Dynamic Objects in 3D Computer Vision.

I am actively looking for a 2023 research internship in 3D Computer Vision (Depth Prediction, 3D Reconstruction, Implicit Representation/NeRF).
