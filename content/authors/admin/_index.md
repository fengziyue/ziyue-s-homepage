I am a Ph.D. student at Clemson University, focusing on geometric learning in 3D Computer Vision, specifically Depth Estimation, 3D Reconstruction, and Neural Radiance Fields.

I'm taking a research internship at Google, working with [Cl√©ment Godard](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/c.godard/) and Lynn Tsai on [Project Starline](https://blog.google/technology/research/project-starline/).

I will start another internship at NVIDIA Research this spring, join [Orazio Gallo](https://research.nvidia.com/person/orazio-gallo)'s group and work with [Hang Su](https://research.nvidia.com/person/hang-su) and [Abhishek Badki](https://research.nvidia.com/person/abhishek-badki) in 3D Computer Vision.

**Actively looking for full-time research scientist/engineer jobs starting in Summer 2024!**
