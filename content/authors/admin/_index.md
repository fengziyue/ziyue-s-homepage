I am a Ph.D. student at Clemson University, focusing on geometric learning in 3D Computer Vision, specifically Depth Estimation, 3D Reconstruction, and Neural Radiance Fields.

I'm thrilled to share that I'll join Google to work with [Cl√©ment Godard](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/c.godard/) and Lynn Tsai for a research internship focused on [Project Starline](https://blog.google/technology/research/project-starline/) this fall.
